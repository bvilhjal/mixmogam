## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- K-free large-n path (BOLT-LMM / LDAK-KVIK design): `GenotypeKinship`
  wraps the genotype store as a streaming linear operator (K x =
  Z(Z'x)/m over SNP blocks, machine-precision equal to the dense GRM),
  and `LMM` accepts it directly for the randomized eigensolver, SLQ
  fitting, scanning and gBLUP -- no n x n matrix is ever formed. SLQ
  deflation is now adaptive by spectral gap (well-separated extremes
  only), fixing a systematic bias when the deflation window crossed a
  near-degenerate bulk.
- Scan transform casts the eigenbasis once per dtype, so float32 scans
  run genuine float32 GEMMs end-to-end: ~3.3x faster than float64 at
  n=2000-5000 (the earlier "float32" path computed in float64
  internally); headline scan speed-up vs the v1-style loop is now 123x.
- Fixed `scan_gxe`: the interaction column is now formed in raw space
  (g * E) and then transformed and residualized. The previous
  product-of-transforms approximation was wrong in general and
  catastrophically degenerate when E is also a covariate; the corrected
  statistic is certified against a direct GLS oracle in the tests.
- Complete revision of the package (the Python-2-era flat modules of v1.0 are
  preserved under the `v1.0-legacy` git tag). mixmogam 2.0 is a modern Python
  (>=3.10) package with a NumPy/SciPy BLAS-3 mixed-model engine:
  - `LMM` fits variance components with the EMMA algorithm (vectorized
    log-delta grid + Newton refinement, REML or ML) and scans SNPs in batched
    GEMM blocks instead of one least-squares solve per SNP, with float32 scan
    arithmetic and chunked SNP streaming.
  - Kinship suite (IBS, realized relationship/IBD, scaling, LOCO, windowed
    local/global) replaces the broken `SNPsDataSet` kinship helpers.
  - Genotype/phenotype containers and IO for PLINK (bed and legacy tped),
    EIGENSTRAT, the v1 CSV formats, and HDF5 (new v2 layout, reads v1).
  - GWAS results container with Manhattan/QQ plotting, genomic-control
    inflation, Bayes factors / posterior probabilities from SNP priors,
    power/FDR analysis.
  - Stepwise multi-locus mixed model (MLMM), GxE scans, batched permutation
    thresholds, 2-df genotypic tests, and 2-kinship mixture models.
  - Test suite with a reference oracle ported from the v1 math; the old
    package had none.
  - Large-n paths: randomized top-k spectrum with identity-tail
    correction (BOLT-LMM style) for n > 8000, and a deflated
    stochastic-Lanczos-quadrature REML/ML solver that needs no O(n^3)
    eigendecomposition (LDAK-KVIK / fastGWA-GLMM style); batched
    permutation thresholds push all replicates through one SNP-block
    GEMM pass (REGENIE-style batching).
  - Optional Numba kernel for the fused int8-to-float block conversion
    with mean imputation (`fast` extra).
  - Benchmarks (measured suite under `benchmarks/`), docs (`docs/`), and
    runnable examples (`examples/`).
  - Simulation study on phensim coalescent data: LMM vs plain-LM genomic
    control (lambda_GC 0.41 -> 1.01, ~769 -> ~2 false positives at 0.5
    confounding), SLQ fits within 1-2% of exact, top-1024 scans with
    94/100 top-hit overlap, subsampled-kinship h2 within 0.01
    (`benchmarks/sim_study.py`, archive 20261002T194331Z-sim-study).
- Missing genotypes are now handled by per-SNP missingness filtering plus mean
  imputation (EMMAX-consistent) so SNP blocks stay batchable; v1's per-SNP
  sample subsetting is available opt-in via `exact_missing=True`.
- Fixed v1 defects by design: `get_ibd_kinship_matrix` TypeError, the
  nonexistent `_calc_*_kinship_*` methods behind chromosome-vs-rest and
  region-split kinships, `update_kinship` stray-`self` bug, integer-division
  and precedence bugs in the QQ helpers, and modeless `h5py.File` calls.
- Dropped the optional rpy2 / R `nearPD` Cholesky fallback (never reached on
  the eigendecomposition path) and the dead PLINK .ped parser.
